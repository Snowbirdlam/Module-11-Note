# Weather API

## Description

This application harbors a space for notes to be taken, saved, and deleted when needed. It facilitates a greater ease in noting down things that need to be remembered in an easy-to-navigate design and straight-forward functionality. I have learned much about GET and POST requests in this project as well as to better integrate Express.js backend together with the frontend.

## Credits

I credit this work to my tutor Andrew Hardemon for helping me through helping me figure out the logic and how the routes work together with the database. Karina also was tremendously helpful in helping me learn how to think through connecting routes and getting it to run more effectively. The T.A. Robert Johnson also assisted in troubleshooting bugs and thinking through the logic of the code itself. Really, it takes a village. I have learned so much from these different mentors and teachers, it gives me a bit more confidence to go do some deeper dive self-study to be more self-sufficient.
